# Riddim Toolkit

Riddim Toolkit is a MIDI generation system for building reggae, rocksteady, and ska rhythm sections. Define your style, set the key, and let the engine output basslines, skanks, bubble organs, and more using groove logic stored in JSON templates.

## Features
- JSON-based groove templates for core reggae styles
- Style knobs for One Drop, Rockers, Ska, and Steppers
- Modular generation: bass, guitar, organ, clav
- MIDI output for DAWs or iOS apps (AUM, Cubasis)

Jam-ready. Style-flexible. Built for beat nerds and groove lovers alike.
